{"name":"Project AEGIS","tagline":"Amalgamation of Economic GeoPolitical Indicators on Society","body":"This is a humble attempt to unify the various complex interweaved socio-economic, geopolitical parameters to measure progress, development, entitlement claims at the various level in a holistic way.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Background\r\n*\"The original motivation of the reservation was the idea of caste based reservation system which was envisioned by William Hunter and Jyotirao Phule in various forms in 1882 and implemented by Chatrapati Sahuji in 1901. The term was changed to \"Depressed Class\" in 1932 by Ambedkar and later to \"Scheduled Caste/Tribes\" during the framing of the constitution in 1950. The idea was that a vast majority of the poor were from a very small caste group and they needed a social net so that they can be accommodated into society as full fledged members. It is important to note that this part of the reservation was for electoral rights first (to guarantee political representation - Poona Act â€˜35) and a education/job rights issue second. Also note that education was made free in these early attempts so that poverty does not hinder their education by these early efforts\"* \r\n\r\nIn India, certains groups recieve entitlements in the form of reservations, fund allotments etc. by virtue of a single parameter i.e. caste. \r\n\r\nTo gurantee equality, progress, fairness of development and the upliftment of the society we need a holistic picture that takes into account the various assortment of factors.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
